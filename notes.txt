custom commands:
  . /// import ./shader_path
    . keep track of what files included and dont import files multiple times
  . /// compute_enable
  . /// work_group_count 64

bugs:

plan:
  /. as some stuff is already pretty specific to buddhabrot/mandlebrot/plotquations, think of a way to
    have them as seperate options instead of just having them in shaders
    /. maybe import main into these shaders and remove the imports from main
    . have an enum that can help with this
    . depending on this enum, shader importer can import these specific shader files (enum.get_path())
    . also these can control the behaviour of shortcut buttons
      . for eg, p in mandlebrot might require clearing the buffers first
  . maybe increase/decrease the cumpute_buffer invocations/iterations_per_frame based on the frame time
    . how do i check fps?
    . ig its already sync cuz get_current_texture() ??
      . is the winit eventloop async?
        . so can another iteration start before one ends?
  . sliders for variables
    . pressing some button + scrolling
  . how anti-aliasing
  . can i dump gifs
  . handle errors properly

mandlebrot:
  /. how do i dump higher rez images while having all pixels completely rendered (requires multiple frames rn)
    /. do not copy the buffers in this
    /. but copy other stuff like, Stuff (maybe?)
  \. maybe do in calculation compute shaders?
    \. how do i make sure that some pixel is done?
      \. put 1 in buffer instead of 0, and if it is 1, its either processing(by some other invocation)/done
      \. this would require atomic stuff tho. might be slow
    \. maybe can impliment in compute shaders in a way that all gets done in single frame when dumping image
      /. hide it behind a toggle (in stuff)
  /. how msaa?
    /. need a buffer for color (color += get_color(i); return color/samples)
    /. a buffer the size of 3*render size is not feasable as the max buffer size already feels small
    /. texture?
