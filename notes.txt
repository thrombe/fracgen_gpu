    . look for wasm examples in wgpu

custom commands:
  . /// import ./shader_path
    . keep track of what files included and dont import files multiple times
  . /// compute_enable
  . /// work_group_count 64

bugs:
  . 

plan:
  . allow to change the size in windowless mode
  . try hybrid + gpustuff
    . maybe the power mode thing can help?
  . check the rust-cuda ray-tracer for how it does things
  . show red/white screen if shader dont compile
  /. send mouse coords in shader so that it can be used for fun things
    . using it as sliders for variables
  . how anti-aliasing
  . how do i check fps?
  . can i dump gifs
  . press button to pause time
  . handle errors properly

gol:
  . figure out how to retain last frame
  . for each pixel, it looks around it by offsets of the cell side to decide if the color should be b or w
  . this way, performance will only depend on the cell count
  . no cpu needed/no buffers needed to store the cell/cell info

plot:
  . 

particle life:
  . how do i represent this efficiently
    . needs access to closeby particles quickly
    . need to define a aoe for forces around the current object
