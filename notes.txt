    . look for wasm examples in wgpu

custom commands:
  . /// import ./shader_path
    . keep track of what files included and dont import files multiple times
  . /// compute_enable
  . /// work_group_count 64

bugs:
  . 

plan:
  /. as some stuff is already pretty specific to buddhabrot/mandlebrot/plotquations, think of a way to
    have them as seperate options instead of just having them in shaders
    /. have an enum that can help with this
    /. depending on this enum, shader importer can import these specific shader files (enum.get_path())
    /. also these can control the behaviour of shortcut buttons
      \. for eg, p in mandlebrot might require clearing the buffers first
  . maybe increase/decrease the cumpute_buffer invocations/iterations_per_frame based on the frame time
    . how do i check fps?
    . ig its already sync cuz get_current_texture() ??
      . is the winit eventloop async?
        . so can another iteration start before one ends?
  . sliders for variables
    . pressing some button + scrolling
  . how anti-aliasing
  . can i dump gifs
